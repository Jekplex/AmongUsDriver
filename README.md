# Among Us Driver
An Among Us discord bot that allows you to mute and unmute players really quickly.

Origin
-----------

The idea for this discord bot occured to me when I was getting fustrated about people continuing to talk after the discussion phase in Among Us. It irritated me and I wanted a fix. So, I decided to make a solution. I called it "Among Us Driver", AUD for short.

How to use
-----------
You can add my bot to your discord server by using the link below.

https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=757258351146041474&permissions=57703504&scope=bot

Note: This link now has appropriate permissions for the current and potential future usage for this bot. If some permissions are not granted, the bot may not work as intended. Also the bot occasionally has development downtime as this is an ongoing project.

The bot's prefix is "."  
Use ".help" for commands. 
"Moderator" is the person executing the command.

Features
-----------
* A moderator can mute and unmute players via command.
* A moderator can move everyone in their current voice channel to another voice channel.
* Each discord server has a game queue.

Game queues allows members of the discord server to join a queue to play Among Us. Moderators can use ".set [code]" to set the game code of the current game lobby. Mods can combine this with ".send" to let the bot send a direct message (with the game code) to the first 10 members in the list. This is a streamer feature to ensure the game code doesn't get leaked mid-stream.
