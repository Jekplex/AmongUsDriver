# Among Us Driver
A discord bot for the game Among Us that allows you to mute and unmute all players really quickly.

Origin
-----------

The idea for this discord bot occured to me when I was getting fustrated about people continuing to talk after the discussion phase in Among Us. It irritated me. I wanted a fix. So I decided to make one. I present to you...

The Among Us Driver!  

Terrible name, I know. I couldn't think of anything else to call it.

You can add my bot to your discord server by using the link below.

Note: This link now has appropriate permissions for the current and potential future usage for this bot. If some permissions are not granted, the bot may not work as intended.

This bot occasionally has development downtime as this is an ongoing project. 

How to use?
-----------
The bot's prefix is "."  
"Moderator" is the person executing the command.

This bot is currently command based. Would be awesome if the Among Us devs had something i could hook into the game that could detect the state of the game. Then muting and unmuting could be automated :)

* .help for commands.

Features:
* Can mute and unmute players via command.
* Can move everyone in your current voice channel to another.
* Has a game queue (current one per server). Players can .join the queue and moderators can ".set [code]" to set the game code for their lobby. Moderators can then use ".send" to send a dm containing the code to the first 10 players in the list. This is a streamer feature to ensure code doesn't get leaked mid-stream.

Potentially more to come...
