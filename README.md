# Among Us Driver
A discord bot for the game Among Us that allows you to mute and unmute all players really quickly.

Origin
-----------

The idea for this discord bot occured to me when I was getting fustrated about people continuing to talk after the discussion phase in Among Us. It irritated me. I wanted a fix. So I decided to make one. I present to you...

The Among Us Driver Bot!  

Terrible name, I know. I couldn't think of anything else to call it.

How To Use
-----------
You can add my bot to your server by using the link below.

https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=757258351146041474&permissions=8&scope=bot

Note: This link gives the bot admin permissions on your server to do whatever it wants. I know, to some of you that may be too much to ask. But I assure you my code is not malicious and any future changes made will be checked to ensure it remains safe to use. I ask for admin permissions for the sole reason of not limiting the bot's future capabilities.

Commands
-----------
The bot's prefix is "."  
For example: ".help"


"Moderator" is the person executing the command.

* .ping - Returns the message: "Pong!"
* .mute - Server mutes all members in the moderators current voice channel.
* .unmute - Server unmutes all members in the moderators current voice channel.
