Origin

The idea for this discord bot occured to me when I was getting fustrated about people continuing to talk after the discussion phase in Among Us. It irritated me. I wanted a fix. So I decided to make one. I present to you...

Terrible name, I know. I couldn't think of anything else to call it.
